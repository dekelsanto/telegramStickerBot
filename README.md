# telegramStickerBot
Python app for Windows which sends a sticker on random intervals to groups it is in

I wrote this script somewhere in 2015 when I was a Python noob, as a practical joke suggested in my friends' Telegram group.
It sent stickers of a friend's cat, Prince, who likes to pull funny faces. While random, it never fails to have a comedic timing to it :)
